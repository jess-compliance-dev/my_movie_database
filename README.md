## General info
🎥 Movie Database is a Python-based console application that allows users to browse, manage, and view detailed information about movies stored in a local database.  All data is managed internally, without relying on external APIs, making it ideal for learning CRUD operations, state management, and database handling.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.14
* Standard Python libraries: `random`, `os`
* Local JSON-based storage (`movie_storage.py`) for persistent data management

## Features
* List all movies with detailed info (title, rating, year, director, actors)
* Add, delete, and update movies
* Search movies by title keyword
* View statistics: average, median, highest, lowest ratings, best/worst movies
* Get a random movie recommendation
* Filter movies by minimum rating, start year, and end year
* Sort movies by rating
* Color-coded console output for readability

## Project Purpose
This project is designed as a learning tool for Python developers to practice:
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Handling local data storage
- Working with console-based user interfaces
- Implementing menu-driven programs
- Managing program state and data validation
- Practicing modular Python coding and clean structure
